I am an undergraduate student in Linguistics at the University of Edinburgh. I am interested in speech technology, semantics, and the philosophy of language. I like to write. So far, mostly in my notebook -- I'm trying to change that. I also like to walk around, do quiz, surf Wikipedia, and overcaffeinate myself. 

This site is made with Jekyll. Jekyll is as simple as it gets. Still unsure if that's simple enough for me.
